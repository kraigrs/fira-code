# What is Fira Code?

* monospaced font with programming ligatures
* ligatures are Unicode symbols for certain operators
* Fira Code is a great font even without ligatures!

# Why use ligatures?

* interpret multiple characters into a single symbol (or glyph)
* save a little space
* fonts have advanced enough to address this

# Why use ligatures?

## **tl;dr** they make code look pretty

# Enabling ligatures in RStudio

* Tools --> Global Options --> Appearance

# What I don't like about ligatures

* Unicode characters don't line up well with other single characters
  + is it still monospace?
* hard to distinguish similar glyphs
* known issues with certain Unix systems
  + https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode/issues/4
  + solved with `sudo apt install fonts-firacode`
